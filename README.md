# Blog app in many stacks.
The goal of this repo is to implement the same app in different techology stacks. The traditional TodoMVC apps are far to simple when you want to dive deeply into a new technology and tend to leave out the back-end piece of the puzzle in most cases.

### Getting Started
To get started, you will need to choose a front-end and from the list below. The README in your chosen front-end will let you know which backends it is compatible with and help you with the next steps.

####List of Frontends:

- ReactJS + Redux (Coming Soon)
- ReactJS + RelayJS (Coming Soon)
- AngularJS 2.0 (Coming Soon)
- BackBoneJS (Coming Soon)
- EmberJS (Coming Soon)

#### List of Backends
While it is recommended that you start with a front-end repo, you can dig right into a back-end repo.

- [NodeJS and REST](back-ends/nodejs-rest)
- [NodeJS and GraphQL](back-ends/nodejs-graphql)
- Rails and REST (Coming Soon)
- Laravel and GraphQL (Coming Soon)

#### Notes
All of these apps are example apps and are works in progress. They may or may not have issues/bugs that wouldn't fly in production.

###Contributing:

Contributions are welcome. More details coming soon.
